How do I approach designing software?

With designing software I look to oragnizing the code and learning what each piece of the software is needed in order to carry out my task. With this project it utilized OpenGl software so I looked into the tutorials and videos on OpenGl in order to understand how it is shaped and organized in order to design it properly. 

How do I approach developing programs?

As for developing programs the approach using iteration was a huge factor into aiding my development. Essentailly breaking down the program into chunks and building once piece at a time in order to make the software functional and to not overload my work as time progressed. Each section such as the controls, textures, rendering code was created one step at a time in order to go from a small program into a larger one. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

With this class in particular it gives me more practice and experience into another aspect of learning computer science. Various jobs and careers revolve around computer graphics in their work (video games of course being a big one) and such experience can push me into that direction in order to improve my experience and perhapse get into a career with graphics.
